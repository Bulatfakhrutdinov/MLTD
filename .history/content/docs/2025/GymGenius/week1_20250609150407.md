Team members and assigned roles.
1. Ivan Chabanov - Team Leader, Mobile Developer. Develop a mobile app; manage the workflow
2. Egor Dushin - Frontend Developer. Develop a frontend for admin panel
3. Kirill Nosov	- Backend Developer. Develop a backend for admin panel
4. Vlad Kuznetsov - DevOps Engineer. Help containerizing; managing the load; write the main backend in go
5. Alexander Mikhailov - Backend Developer, ML Engineer. Develop backend for admin panel; Manage tasks related to ML in application.

Chosen project idea, problem statement, target users.
- The idea is to build a workout tracker with comprehensive and understandable analytics with the power of AI. Problem - some people enjoy going to the gym, or just go there, but they do not want to take a personal trainer for comprehensive analysis. For those people we build this application.

2. Project Idea, Problem Statement & Target Users

Idea. GymGenius is a smart workout tracker that pairs intuitive logging with AI-powered feedback, giving gym-goers data-driven insights without the cost of a personal trainer.

Problem. Enthusiasts often track workouts in spreadsheets or basic apps lacking meaningful analytics. Personal trainers provide insight, but are expensive and time-bound.

Target users.
	1.	Self-coached gym enthusiasts seeking actionable metrics.
	2.	Beginners who need guidance but cannot afford a trainer.
	3.	Coaches wanting a quick overview of client progress.

3. High-Level User Stories & Initial MVP Scope

ID	User Story	Acceptance Criteria
US-1	As a user, I can create an account and set training goals so that analytics are personalised.	Sign-up via email/social; goal stored in DB.
US-2	As a user, I can add workouts with exercises, sets, reps and weight in under 30 s.	Autocomplete exercise names; offline-first.
US-3	As a user, I receive AI-generated insights after logging a workout.	Insight card appears ≤5 s post-sync.
US-4	As a user, I can view trend charts for volume, intensity and 1RM over time.	Charts update instantly when data changes.
US-5	As a user, I can capture a short video and receive form feedback scored 1–5.	ML inference ≤3 s; feedback stored.
US-6	As a user, I can sync data with Apple Health / Google Fit.	One-tap OAuth; daily background sync.
US-7	As an admin, I can manage the exercise catalogue and model parameters from a Vue web panel.	CRUD screens protected by auth.
US-8	As DevOps, I can deploy the full stack with one docker compose up.	README passes CI smoke test.

Initial MVP scope (12 weeks).
	•	Mobile: workout logging (US-1, 2) and trend analytics (US-4).
	•	AI: textual insight generation stub (US-3) and form feedback PoC (US-5).
	•	Sync: Google Fit integration subset (US-6).
	•	Backend: exercise catalogue, auth, analytics endpoints.
	•	Admin panel: Vue CRUD for exercises (US-7) on FastAPI backend.
	•	DevOps: CI/CD pipeline, one-click deployment (US-8).

5. Chosen Tech Stack & Justification

Layer	Technology	Why it fits
Mobile App	Flutter 3.22 · Dart 3 · Bloc · SQLite	Single codebase for iOS & Android; high FPS for charts; Bloc ensures testable state; SQLite enables offline logging.
Core API / Analytics	Go 1.22 · Gin · gRPC-Gateway · PostgreSQL 14+	Go offers low-latency concurrency for real-time analytics; Gin is lightweight; gRPC-Gateway exposes both REST & gRPC; Postgres handles relational workout data & JSON insights.
Admin Panel – Front End	Vue 3 (Vite) · TypeScript 5 · Pinia · shadcn/ui	Vue’s Composition API simplifies complex state; Vite builds fast bundled output; Pinia store is ergonomic; shadcn/ui provides accessible, themeable components.
Admin Panel – Back End	Python 3.12 · FastAPI · SQLAlchemy	FastAPI generates OpenAPI docs automatically and offers async performance; Python accelerates developer productivity; SQLAlchemy ORM speeds up CRUD without sacrificing flexibility.
AI Services	OpenAI API · Go concurrency workers	LLMs deliver natural-language insights with minimal R&D; Go worker pool scales asynchronous generation.
DevOps / Infra	Docker Compose · GitHub Actions CI · Terraform (Linode)	Compose brings dev/prod parity; Actions automate testing & image pushes; Terraform codifies infra for reproducible, cost-controlled deployments.
