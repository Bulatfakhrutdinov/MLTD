Team members and assigned roles.
1. Ivan Chabanov - Team Leader, Mobile Developer. Develop a mobile app; manage the workflow
2. Egor Dushin - Frontend Developer. Develop a frontend for admin panel
3. Kirill Nosov	- Backend Developer. Develop a backend for admin panel
4. Vlad Kuznetsov - DevOps Engineer. Help containerizing; managing the load; write the main backend in go
5. Alexander Mikhailov - Backend Developer, ML Engineer. Develop backend for admin panel; Manage tasks related to ML in application.

Chosen project idea, problem statement, target users.
- The idea is to build a workout tracker with comprehensive and understandable analytics with the power of AI. Problem - some people enjoy going to the gym, or just go there, but they do not want to take a personal trainer for comprehensive analysis. For those people we build this application.

Capstone Project Report – GymGenius

1. Team Members & Assigned Roles

Name	Role	Responsibilities
Ivan Chabanov	Team Leader · Mobile Developer	Drive overall vision, manage agile workflow, implement Flutter mobile app

Kirill Nosov	Back-End Developer	Design REST/gRPC APIs, implement core business logic in Go
Vlad Kuznetsov	DevOps Engineer	Containerisation, IaC, performance monitoring, write high-load services in Go
Alexander Mikhailov	Back-End & ML Engineer	Build AI inference services, integrate OpenAI, develop analytics micro-service

2. Project Idea, Problem Statement & Target Users

Idea. GymGenius is a smart workout tracker that pairs intuitive logging with AI-powered feedback to help gym-goers improve performance without hiring a personal trainer.

Problem. Enthusiasts often lack data-driven insights into their training. Existing apps either over-simplify metrics or hide them behind expensive coaching subscriptions.

Target users.
	1.	Self-coached gym enthusiasts who want objective analytics.
	2.	Beginners who need guidance but cannot afford a trainer.
	3.	Coaches who need a quick way to review clients’ data.

3. High-Level User Stories & Initial Scope (MVP)

#	User Story	Acceptance Criteria
US-1	As a user, I can create an account and set training goals so that analytics are personalised.	Sign-up via email/social; goal saved to DB.
US-2	As a user, I can add workouts with exercises, sets, reps and weight in under 30 s.	Form auto-completes exercise names; offline first.
US-3	As a user, I receive AI-generated insights (e.g., “increase weight on bench press by 2.5 kg next session”).	Insight card appears after syncing workout.
US-4	As a user, I can view trend charts for volume, intensity and 1RM over time.	Charts update instantly when data changes.
US-5	As a user, I can capture a short video and get form feedback scored 1-5.	ML inference ≤ 3 s; feedback stored.
US-6	As a user, I can sync data with Apple Health / Google Fit.	One-tap authorisation; daily background sync.
US-7	As an admin, I can manage the exercise catalogue and model parameters from a web panel.	CRUD screens with auth guard.
US-8	As DevOps, I can deploy the full stack with one docker compose up.	Readme passes CI smoke test.

Initial MVP scope (12 weeks).
	•	Mobile: workout logging (US-1,2), trend analytics (US-4).
	•	AI: textual insight generation stub (US-3), form feedback PoC (US-5) using uploaded videos.
	•	Sync: Google Fit integration (subset of US-6).
	•	Backend: exercise catalogue, auth, analytics endpoints.
	•	Admin panel: basic CRUD for exercises (US-7).
	•	DevOps: CI/CD pipeline, one-click deployment (US-8).

5. Chosen Tech Stack & Justification

Layer	Technology	Why it fits
Mobile	Flutter 3.22 · Dart 3 · Bloc · SQLite	Single codebase for Android/iOS; high FPS for charts; Bloc ensures testable state; local SQLite enables offline logging.
API / Core	Go 1.22 · Gin · gRPC-Gateway · PostgreSQL 14+	Go offers low-latency concurrency for real-time analytics; Gin is lightweight; gRPC-Gateway exposes automatic REST+gRPC; Postgres handles relational workout data & JSON insights well.
Admin UI	React 18 (Vite) · TypeScript 5 · shadcn/ui · TanStack Query	Familiar stack for rapid UI; type-safety reduces bugs; shadcn accelerates consistent design; TanStack Query handles cache & retries.
AI Services	OpenAI API · Go concurrency workers	Off-the-shelf LLMs minimise research overhead; worker pool pattern in Go scales asynchronous insight generation.
DevOps	Docker Compose · GitHub Actions CI · Terraform (Linode)	Compose gives parity between dev/prod; Actions automates tests & image builds; Terraform codifies infra for reproducible deployments and cost control.
