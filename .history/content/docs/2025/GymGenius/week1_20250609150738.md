Team members and assigned roles.
1. Ivan Chabanov - Team Leader, Mobile Developer. Develop a mobile app; manage the workflow
2. Egor Dushin - Frontend Developer. Develop a frontend for admin panel
3. Kirill Nosov	- Backend Developer. Develop a backend for admin panel
4. Vlad Kuznetsov - DevOps Engineer. Help containerizing; managing the load; write the main backend in go
5. Alexander Mikhailov - Backend Developer, ML Engineer. Develop backend for admin panel; Manage tasks related to ML in application.

Chosen project idea, problem statement, target users.
- The idea is to build a workout tracker with comprehensive and understandable analytics with the power of AI. Problem - some people enjoy going to the gym, or just go there, but they do not want to take a personal trainer for comprehensive analysis. For those people we build this application.

2. Project Overview

2.1 Idea

GymGenius is a smart workout tracker that combines intuitive logging with AI‑powered feedback, giving gym‑goers data‑driven insights normally available only through a personal trainer.

2.2 Problem Statement

Enthusiasts often record workouts in spreadsheets or basic apps that lack meaningful analytics. Personal trainers provide insight but are expensive and time‑bound.

2.3 Target Users
	•	Self‑coached enthusiasts who crave actionable metrics.
	•	Beginners needing guidance but unable to afford a trainer.
	•	Coaches looking for a quick overview of client progress.

3. High‑Level User Stories & Initial MVP Scope

ID	User Story	Acceptance Criteria
US‑1	As a user, I can create an account and set training goals so that analytics are personalised.	Sign‑up via email/social; goal saved in DB.
US‑2	As a user, I can add workouts with exercises, sets, reps, and weight in under 30 s.	Autocomplete exercise names; offline‑first.
US‑3	As a user, I receive AI‑generated insights after logging a workout.	Insight card appears ≤ 5 s post‑sync.
US‑4	As a user, I can view trend charts for volume, intensity, and 1RM over time.	Charts update instantly when data changes.
US‑5	As a user, I can capture a short video and receive form feedback scored 1‑5.	ML inference ≤ 3 s; feedback stored.
US‑6	As a user, I can sync data with Apple Health / Google Fit.	One‑tap OAuth; daily background sync.
US‑7	As an admin, I can manage the exercise catalogue and model parameters from a Vue web panel.	CRUD screens protected by auth.
US‑8	As DevOps, I can deploy the full stack with one docker compose up.	README passes CI smoke test.

Initial MVP (12‑week) Scope
	•	Mobile: US‑1, US‑2, US‑4
	•	AI: US‑3 (text insight stub), US‑5 (form feedback PoC)
	•	Sync: Partial US‑6 (Google Fit)
	•	Backend: Exercise catalogue, auth, analytics endpoints
	•	Admin Panel: Vue CRUD for exercises (US‑7) on FastAPI backend
	•	DevOps: CI/CD pipeline, one‑click deployment (US‑8)

5. Tech Stack & Justification

Layer	Technology	Rationale
Mobile App	Flutter 3.22 · Dart 3 · Bloc · SQLite	Single codebase for iOS & Android; high FPS for charts; Bloc ensures testable state; SQLite enables offline logging.
Core API / Analytics	Go 1.22 · Gin · gRPC‑Gateway · PostgreSQL 14+	Go offers low‑latency concurrency for real‑time analytics; Gin is lightweight; gRPC‑Gateway exposes REST & gRPC; Postgres handles relational data & JSON insights.
Admin Panel – Front End	Vue 3 (Vite) · TypeScript 5 · Pinia · shadcn/ui	Composition API simplifies complex state; Vite builds fast bundles; Pinia is ergonomic; shadcn/ui provides accessible, themeable components.
Admin Panel – Back End	Python 3.12 · FastAPI · SQLAlchemy	FastAPI autogenerates OpenAPI docs and offers async performance; Python accelerates dev speed; SQLAlchemy ORM speeds up CRUD without sacrificing flexibility.
AI Services	OpenAI API · Go concurrency workers	LLMs deliver natural‑language insights with minimal R&D; Go worker pool scales asynchronous generation.
DevOps / Infra	Docker Compose · GitHub Actions CI · Terraform (Linode)	Compose brings dev/prod parity; Actions automate tests & image pushes; Terraform codifies infra for reproducible, cost‑controlled deployments.
