# Week 3

## **Implemented MVP features**

1. As a student, I want to post a new project with a description and required skills, so that I can find teammates who match my needs.
    
    > Given I am logged in and have completed my profile, when I click “My projects→Create project,” then I see a form with fields: title, description, required skills, status, project link.
    Given I have submitted the form, then the project appears in the public project feed.
    Given I return to “My projects”, then I can see, edit, or delete my posted project.
    > 
    
    **Implemented:**
    
    - 
2. As a student, I want to apply to projects that match my interests, so that I can participate in projects relevant to my skills and goals.
    
    > Given I see a project in the feed, when I click “Apply,” then I can submit the request.
    Given I applied to a project, then I can see my application status in the “My responses” tab.
    > 
    
    **Implemented:**

3. As a student, I want to see suggestions and filters when browsing projects, so that I can efficiently choose which projects to join.

    **Implemented:**
